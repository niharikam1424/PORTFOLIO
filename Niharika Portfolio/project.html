    <p>Implementation of IoT based Medicine Reminder.</p><br>
    <pre>
        In modern society, busy life has made people forget many things in day to day life. The
        elderly people and the people victims of chronicle diseases who need to take the medicines
        timely without missing are suffering from dementia, which is forgetting things in their daily
        routine. Considering this situation study has been done in this. Project reviewing the
        technologies of home health care which are currently used for improving this situation by
        reminding the scheduled of medicine, remote monitoring and update new medicine data of
        patients, which can be done by prescriber.

    <p>Motion based power saver using passive infrared (PIR) sensor.</p>
    <pre>
        This project is to implement the system for power saving. This paper presents the implementation of the power saving system. 
        For the power control system, detection method is used for a power ON/OFF automatically in respective place. The heart of 
        this project is the sensor portion. In the supplying power, sensor unit is employed for switching stage. Passive 
        infrared (PIR) sensor detects the motion of a person and these data is converted into the electrical signal and this signal
        is sent to the switching for processing. This signal creates a specific voltage for the relay to activate 
        the power switching. But nobody is detected the power is automatically turned off. As a consequence, the constructed energy 
        control system prevents energy wastage.
